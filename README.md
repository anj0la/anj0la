- 👋 Hi, I’m @anj0la!
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development, and full-stack development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to make applications with Android Studio, and am hoping to start learning C, along with C++ at some point. I'm hoping to create iPhone apps too in the near future.
- 💞️ I’m collaborating on an Android app alongside some of my classmates.
- 📫 You can reach me either here, or on discord (anjola#1111).
