Hello, my name is Anjola! I'm a third year student at the University of Alberta! I enjoy doing UX/UI development alongside creating fun games, but am also becoming more interested in back-end development!

I have two projects that I am continually working on at the moment, Candy Invaders and a Property Management Application. You can check out those repositories under the "Pinned" section to see the progress I've made on those two repositories!

I have over 2 years of experience programming in the following langauges:
  - Java
  - Python
  
The following programming languages below are languages that I have learned over the course of 2022, and am continually developing my skills in them:
  - C/C++
  - C#
  - Scheme
