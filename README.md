Hello, my name is Anjola! I'm a third year student at the University of Alberta! I enjoy doing UX/UI development alongside creating fun games, but am also becoming more interested in back-end development!

I have two games that I have completed and doing some small updates on them - Candy Invaders and Ocean Cleaning Frenzy! You can check out those repositories under the "Pinned" section.

I've also created a simple Property Management Application that I hope to revamp over this summer to support mobile integration. You can check out what I've currently done so far under the "Pinned" section as well.

Finally, I'm working on an original game to be released on multiple platforms (i.e., macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS & Android). The repository will be up in the upcoming weeks, and I hope to finish it by the time I finish school (April 2023).

I have over 2 years of experience programming in the following langauges:
  - Java
  - Python

I have a little over 6 months of experience programming in the following languages:
  - C++
  - C

I have some experience in the following languages (including markup languages):
  - JavaScript
  - PHP
  - HTML
  - XML
  - Scheme
  - Prolog
