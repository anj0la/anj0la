Hello, my name is Anjola! I'm a fourth year student at the University of Alberta! I enjoy doing UX/UI development alongside creating fun games, but am also becoming more interested in back-end development!

I just recently completed creating a simple multt-threaded snake game for my Parallel and Distributed Computing course as my course project! It was created in around a week, and made use of the Allegro 4.4.2 game library. I have two games that I have completed and doing some small updates on them - Candy Invaders and Ocean Cleaning Frenzy! You can check out those repositories under the "Pinned" section. I've also created a simple Property Management Application that I hope to revamp over this summer to support mobile integration.

Finally, I'm working on an original game to be released on multiple platforms (i.e., macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS & Android). The repository will be up in the upcoming weeks, and I hope to finish it fully by the end of Summer 2023.

I have over 3 years of experience programming in the following langauges:
  - Java
  - Python

I have over 1 years' worth of experience programming in the following languages:
  - C++
  - C

I have some experience in the following languages (including markup languages):
  - JavaScript
  - PHP
  - HTML
  - XML
  - Scheme
  - Prolog
